      "Summary": "The book is written for managers who have to supervise and control their employees as well as complete certain essential office tasks. It covers certain techniques that could help its readers in improving their productivity, job satisfaction and personal prosperity. This is because individual satisfaction can gradually lead to the growth of any organisation. The authors of the book Kenneth Hartley Blanchard and Spencer Johnson have briefly explained few methods of management that are based on few studies in medicine and behavioural sciences. The book talks about three practical management techniques such as one minute goal setting, one minute praising and one minute reprimand. These three simple yet effective techniques could do wonders for both individual and organisational growth. The one minute goal setting technique says that each member of a team is essential to fulfil the set goals. For instance, in order to complete daily, weekly, monthly or yearly tasks, team effort is needed, and for that, individual effort matters a lot. One minute praising technique is all about appreciation. According to this technique a manager must reward a team member for completing a specific task efficiently. Plus, a manager could spend a minute to acknowledge a hardworking employee. The last technique is one-minute reprimand that says that the manager has to give feedback to few members who committed mistakes in their tasks. But the feedback must be given in polite manner so that their interpersonal relations are not affected.",

        "Summary": "In Search of Lost Time (French: À la recherche du temps perdu), first translated into English as Remembrance of Things Past, and sometimes referred to in French as La Recherche (The Search), is a novel in seven volumes by French author Marcel Proust. This early 20th-century work is his most prominent, known both for its length and its theme of involuntary memory. The most famous example of this is the \"episode of the madeleine\",which occurs early in the first volume. The novel gained fame in English in translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin as Remembrance of Things Past, but the title In Search of Lost Time, a literal rendering of the French, became ascendant after D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992. In Search of Lost Time follows the narrator's recollections of childhood and experiences into adulthood in the late 19th-century and early 20th-century high-society France, while reflecting on the loss of time and lack of meaning in the world.[1] The novel began to take shape in 1909. Proust continued to work on it until his final illness in the autumn of 1922 forced him to break off. Proust established the structure early on, but even after volumes were initially finished, he continued to add new material and edited one volume after another for publication. The last three of the seven volumes contain oversights and fragmentary or unpolished passages, as they existed only in draft form at the death of the author; the publication of these parts was overseen by his brother Robert.",

        "Summary": "In Search of Lost Time (French: À la recherche du temps perdu), first translated into English as Remembrance of Things Past, and sometimes referred to in French as La Recherche (The Search), is a novel in seven volumes by French author Marcel Proust. This early 20th-century work is his most prominent, known both for its length and its theme of involuntary memory. The most famous example of this is the \"episode of the madeleine\",which occurs early in the first volume. The novel gained fame in English in translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin as Remembrance of Things Past, but the title In Search of Lost Time, a literal rendering of the French, became ascendant after D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992. In Search of Lost Time follows the narrator's recollections of childhood and experiences into adulthood in the late 19th-century and early 20th-century high-society France, while reflecting on the loss of time and lack of meaning in the world.[1] The novel began to take shape in 1909. Proust continued to work on it until his final illness in the autumn of 1922 forced him to break off. Proust established the structure early on, but even after volumes were initially finished, he continued to add new material and edited one volume after another for publication. The last three of the seven volumes contain oversights and fragmentary or unpolished passages, as they existed only in draft form at the death of the author; the publication of these parts was overseen by his brother Robert."
